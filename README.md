# War card game

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/w0174unQQjs>

#### Description:

This Python program implements the classic card game "War" in the terminal with ASCII art printed cards. The game pits two players against each other, each drawing a card from their deck in turns. The player with the higher card value wins the round and collects both cards. In the event of a tie, a "war" occurs where each player draws three additional cards face down, followed by a fourth card face up. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards in that round. The game continues until one player has all the cards or a specified number of rounds have been played.

#### Features:

ASCII art representation of playing cards for visual appeal in the terminal.
Simple gameplay mechanics following the rules of the traditional "War" card game.
Option to play against the computer or another human player.
Customizable number of rounds or play until one player collects all the cards.
Easy-to-understand interface suitable for players of all ages.

#### Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Run the script using Python (python war_game.py).
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Enjoy the classic card game experience with a nostalgic twist!
